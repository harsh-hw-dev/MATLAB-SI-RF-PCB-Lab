# HighSpeed-PCB-SignalIntegrity-MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB-based projects focused on **high-speed PCB signal integrity and RF analysis**.  
All simulations aim to analyze real-world PCB behavior at a **physics and transmission-line level**, not idealized textbook cases.

---

## 📌 Scope of This Repository

The projects in this repository analyze:

- Transmission line behavior in high-speed PCBs  
- Impedance mismatch and reflections  
- S-parameters (S11 focus)  
- VSWR analysis  
- Termination techniques  
- Time-domain and frequency-domain behavior  
- Signal degradation, ringing, and overshoot  

All simulations are designed to reflect **practical PCB design scenarios**.

## 🔍 Why This Repo Exists

Most high-speed PCB failures come from:
- Ignoring transmission line effects  
- Blind impedance assumptions  
- Poor termination choices  

This repo exists to **simulate, visualize, and understand** those effects before touching PCB layout tools.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

These simulations are **analysis tools**, not PCB layout replacements.  
Always validate results using:
- Field solvers
- Measurement (TDR, VNA)
- Real PCB prototypes
